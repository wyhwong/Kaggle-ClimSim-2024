# Kaggle-ClimSim-2024

This is the repository for the Kaggle competition [LEAP - Atmospheric Physics using AI (ClimSim)](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/leap-atmospheric-physics-ai-climsim). The goal of the competition is to develop machine learning models that accurately emulate subgrid-scale atmospheric physics in an operational climate modelâ€”an important step in improving climate projections and reducing uncertainty surrounding future climate trends.

In this repository, our development is based on the deep learning framework [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/), leveraging [PyTorch Lightning](https://lightning.ai/docs/pytorch/stable/) to streamline the training process, [poetry](https://python-poetry.org/) for dependency management. Our linting, type checking, and formatting tools include [black](https://black.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [pylint](https://pylint.readthedocs.io/en/stable/), [isort](https://pycqa.github.io/isort/), and [mypy](https://mypy.readthedocs.io/en/stable/).

## Usage

```bash
git clone https://github.com/wyhwong/Kaggle-ClimSim-2024.git
cd Kaggle-ClimSim-2024
